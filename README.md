# PRODIGY_GA_03
This repository contains the solution for a text generation task using **Markov Chains**. The goal of this project is to generate coherent text sequences based on patterns learned from a dataset, using the Markov Chain model.

## Overview

Text generation is the process of automatically creating meaningful text based on an input dataset. In this project, we utilize **Markov Chains** to generate sequences of text, which rely on probabilistic transitions between states (words or characters) based on a given input text dataset.

The repository also includes the script to download data from Hugging Face and save it locally in CSV format for further processing in the Markov Chain model.
